# Contributing

0. Open an issue to discuss the feature you want to implement or need. This will help us to figure out how to fit it in and will avoid unnecessary work on your part.
1. Implement whatever you want and write tests
2. Make sure `npm test` passes. This will run your tests and lint the code.
3. Once you are happy with the code, add yourself to project contributors (below).
4. Create a PR against the `master` branch

## Development

```code
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8080
```

Now edit `./demos`.

There's also a TDD mode for testing. Run it through `npm run tdd` and develop while it's running.
