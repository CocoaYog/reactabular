Given Reactabular is flexible by design, it's not the easiest to use and you may have to do quite a bit of wiring to make it work the way you want. `reactabular-easy` has been designed to make using it easier. It is opinionated and takes away some power. But on the plus side it allows you to render a fully featured table faster.

```jsx
<EasyTable rows={rows} columns={columns} />
```
