Reactabular is granular by default and you will have to choose which packages to install (`npm install` or `npm i`) yourself. The following image lists the major ones:

![Reactabular packages](./images/overall.png)

The packages expect Lodash 4 in order to work!

[reactabular-easy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactabular-easy) is an exception to this rule as it uses multiple packages. You still have to install the Reactabular specific ones yourself as those have been marked as peer dependencies.
